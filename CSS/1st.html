                We are a group of highly trained mercenaries with high equipped weapons and have the ability to see through peoples and hear from great distances. We work in
                a productive manner and kill bad people who search for Godly super powered objects and use them against the whole humanity. We are crowned as criminals because
                we hide from people to save them yet the irony that people loves Batman and hates us though we all deserve to be loved. This is called nepotism word what ever 
                ...ism!! it is but we are good people and working for you without any funding. We take our fundings from the people we kill. You guys may call us theif but in 
                reality we are just taking what we deserve because as we are not funded by Bruce Wayne. So if you want to be a non profited saviour of people who will always 
                hate you!!! You are more than welcome to join us.

                It is the most important requirement for an Assassin. <span class="italics">If you ever feel that you can see visions through wall or long range visions unlike peoples you are
                an Assassin born or have a Assassin blood in your genes.</span> This is a very important requirement because we work mostly in the dark or being hidden this 
                ability guides makes seeing through things easier. We can see the enemies thourgh objects and ambushing them in the dark. With this ability you can detect 
                your targets and see potential threats. <br/>

                <p>Having ninja skills is very important for an Assassin. As we know we are kind of a Dark Knights we will be working in the shadows therfore there will 
                    be many people on our asses. So you have to be quick on your feet. Gymnastics is a huge part of Assassin recruitment such as fast running, high 
                    jump, climbing
                    swimming. This skill will assist in disappearing instantenously or causing distraction without disclosing yourself or stay hidden like a ninja even 
                    in broad daylight.
